INFO:ConstraintSystem - The Period constraint <NET "Clk_50MHz" PERIOD = 20.0ns
   HIGH 50%;> [GenIO.ucf(3)], is specified using the Net Period method which is
   not recommended. Please use the Timespec PERIOD method.

Checking expanded design ...
ERROR:NgdBuild:604 - logical block 'XLXI_83' with type 'KbdDecode' could not be
   resolved. A pin name misspelling can cause this, a missing edif or ngc file,
   case mismatch between the block name and the edif or ngc file name, or the
   misspelling of a type name. Symbol 'KbdDecode' is not supported in target
   'spartan3e'.
